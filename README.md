# CIS 012: Introduction to Programming (Python)

This is a repository for the course material used for the Pasadena City College's CIS 012: Introduction to Programming
using Python as taught by James Mertz.

These notebooks are adapted from content from the following sources:

- Python for Everybody by Charles Severance
- Python Basics by Real Python
- Clean Coding by Robert Martin

## Structure

This repository is broken up into two major sections:

1. **Lecture Material:** Major content of the course.  This is where all the lecture material can be found including any
   examples that may have been worked in previous courses.  The lecture material is all created using Jupyter Notebooks
   and can be viewed directly within GitHub but is recommended to be cloned into an Azure Notebooks repo.
2. **Project Material:** Project information and templates.  This is where all content related to the final project can
   be found.

## Setup (Azure Notebooks)

You can clone or download this repository and run the notebooks on your own machine is that's what you want, but I
recommend using Azure Notebooks.  Azure Notebooks is a free service provided by Microsoft that hosts your Jupyter
Notebooks and can even clone GitHub Repos.

To clone a repo into Azure Notebooks:

1. Navigate to [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com)
2. Sign in (or create an account)
3. Select "My Projects"
4. Select "Upload GitHub Repo"
5. copy and paste `https://github.com/mertzjames/pcc-cis-012-intro-to-programming-python` into the repo location
6. Make the project name `PCC CIS 012`
7. Make the project id `pcc-cis-012`
8. Select "I trust the contents of this repo"
9. Select "Import" (this may take some time)

Additionally, you can follow the instructions outlined in this video:
